# 💻 Cli First
FileSorterX is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help users automatically organize and sort their files. What sets FileSorterX apart from other similar tools is the separation between its library and the CLI tool. The library provides all of the core functionality like the creation and sorting of files. While the CLI tool serves as a convenient interface for users to interact with the library think of it as a cli wrapper. Although the primary focus is on the CLI application, the separation of the library and the tool ensures that users have the flexibility to integrate the sorting and organization functionality into their own projects or applications. With FileSorterX, users can easily manage and organize their files without having to spend hours doing it manually.
